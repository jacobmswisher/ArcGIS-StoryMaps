## Part 1: ArcGIS StoryMaps - An Overview

[ArcGIS StoryMaps](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/) is a browser-based presentation platform that allows users to integrate maps, spatial data, text, and other media in a compelling online presentation. The best way to get a sense of what *you* can do with ArcGIS StoryMaps is to explore some of the amazing StoryMaps others have created using ESRI's platform.
