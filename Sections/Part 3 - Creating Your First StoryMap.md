## Part 3: Creating Your First StoryMap

Now that you've explored some exemplary StoryMaps and thought about the design principles behind good data visualizations, it's time to create your first StoryMap!

### Step 1: Log Into ArcGIS Online and Navigate to ArcGIS StoryMaps

To start working in ArcGIS StoryMaps, an application in ESRI's ArcGIS Online platform, head to the sign-in page at [https://www.arcgis.com](https://www.arcgis.com).

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/jacobmswisher/images/blob/main/ArcGIS%20StoryMaps/Figure%203.JPG">
</p>

At the sign-in page, you'll need to log on with the organizational login assigned to you by your system administrator. **For ND users, your username is your own version of netid_NotreDame. Just substitute your netid into the template.** If you do not have an organizational login, you can create a free account which will give you access to a limited number of features on ArcGIS Online.

Then, click the button with nine dots next to your username to open the application menu and click on the ArcGIS StoryMaps logo to get started.

</p>

### Step 2: Create a StoryMap

To create a new StoryMap, simply click the new story button at the upper-right-hand corner of your browser. When you create a new StoryMap, ESRI will provide you with a number of options, each of which can be useful for helping you to create a specific type of data experience for your viewers. For this workshop, however, we'll simply begin with a blank StoryMap. Click the start from scratch option to create your first StoryMap.

<p align="center">

</p>

### Step 3: Add Media Content to the StoryMap

After creating a new StoryMap, ArcGIS StoryMaps will automatically take you to a browser window where you can begin creating your spatial story. Here, ArcGIS StoryMaps provides you with the option to change the theme and layout of sections of your story using the design tab, to preview your story as though you were a viewer using the preview tab, and to publish your work online once you have finished creating your StoryMap.

The most important tool in ArcGIS StoryMaps, however, is this one:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/jacobmswisher/images/blob/main/ArcGIS%20StoryMaps/Figure%206.jpg">
</p>

The add content button allows you to create and add text and media to your StoryMap or to integrate features such as a map tour or slider into your data visualizations. Click on the add content button to open up the full list of options for creating and adding content items to your StoryMap.

In this workshop, we are going learn how to use the add content button by adding to items to your first StoryMap, an image and an express map. Go ahead and click on the image option to add your first media item to your StoryMap.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/jacobmswisher/images/blob/main/ArcGIS%20StoryMaps/Figure%207.jpg">
</p>

Depending on the type of content you want to add to your StoryMap, ESRI will ask you to point ArcGIS StoryMaps to one of two locations for that content item:
1. In your files on ArcGIS Online, which are accessible via the [Content Tab](https://arcgis.com/home/content.html).
2. From a web address where the content item is hosted.

In this case, we will rely on the link function to add an image of the University of Notre Dame's iconic Golden Dome to your draft StoryMap. You can find the image and link for this step [here](https://stories.nd.edu/assets/382669/original/10_lakes.jpg).

To add the image of the Golden Dome to your StoryMap, select the link option from the add an image tool pane, paste the link for the Golden Dome image into the add image tool, and click the add button.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/jacobmswisher/images/blob/main/ArcGIS%20StoryMaps/Figure%208.jpg">
</p>

After you add the Golden Dome image to your StoryMap, hover your cursor over your new content item. Doing so will bring up a range of options to move, manage, and delete the content item. Use these options as needed to design the best possible version of your StoryMap. 

### Exercise 2: Adding Content to Your StoryMap

**Task: On your own, find and add at least two new content items from the web to your StoryMap. Try to add one that is not an image.**

### Step 4: Add a New Data Visualization to Your StoryMap

Next, we will add an express map to your new StoryMap. ArcGIS StoryMaps allows you to create express maps in the StoryMaps platform, a process that involves desigining a data visualization for your StoryMap from scratch.

To create an express map, click the add content button, select the map option, and click the new express map button in the upper-right-hand corner of your browser.

*Note: You can also add maps you create and save in ArcGIS Online to your StoryMap, which ArcGIS StoryMaps will display based on your last set of saved map settings (chosen layers, symbology, etc.). You can review the process for creating and saving a map in ArcGIS Online [here](https://github.com/jacobmswisher/ArcGIS-Online#part-3-gathering-spatial-data).*

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/jacobmswisher/images/blob/main/ArcGIS%20StoryMaps/Figure%209.jpg">
</p>

The express map tool allows you to create a new map and associated spatial data for use **only** in ArcGIS StoryMaps. Express maps are a convenient option if you don't require the more advanced customization offered when working with layers in ArcGIS Online.

For your first express map, you are going to create a walking tour of a few popular sites on campus starting with the Golden Dome. To get started, zoom in on your map, find the University of Notre Dame, and select the add numbered points option from the toolbar at the top of your browser.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/jacobmswisher/images/blob/main/ArcGIS%20StoryMaps/Figure%2010.jpg">
</p>

Selecting one of the tools for creating features will transform your cursor in to a data creation tool, allowing you to populate your express map with features by clicking. You can continue to move around the map by clicking and holding your cursor, which will allow you to drag the map as you navigate to other locations.

Begin by clicking on the Golden Dome to create a new feature on your express map. Then, add a name and description for your new feature, adjust the style if you prefer something else, and click done to create the feature.

*Hint: If you are having trouble finding the Golden Dome using Canvas Light, the default basemap, click on the settings button on the left side of your browser to select a new basemap. The image below is using the Imagery basemap.*

<p align="center">

</p>

To finish this express map, create point features for the Basicila of the Sacred Heart and the Hesburgh Library. Then, click the done button to save your changes.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/jacobmswisher/images/blob/main/ArcGIS%20StoryMaps/Figure%2012.jpg">
</p>

Congratulations! You have successfully added a data visualization to your StoryMap.

*Hint: To make an ordered features express map more interactive, begin by choosing the map tour option in the add content button menu.*

### Exercise 3: Add a Second Data Visualization to Your StoryMap

**Task: On your own, take some time to add a second data visualization to your StoryMap. You can create a new express map, map tour, or add an existing map you own from ArcGIS Online.**

### Step 5: Publishing Your StoryMap on the Web

When you are done adding creating a new StoryMap, the next step is to publish your StoryMap which will make the story available to viewers on the internet.

To publish your StoryMap, click the publish tab at the top of your browser.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/jacobmswisher/images/blob/main/ArcGIS%20StoryMaps/Figure%2013.jpg">
</p>

Next, adjust the story card and sharing options if needed. For this workshop, you will publish your draft StoryMap privately, which means that only you can view the published version. However, if you were creating a StoryMap intended for public use or use on the campus GIS network, you would adjust the sharing permissions accordingly.

Click the publish button to publish your StoryMap.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/jacobmswisher/images/blob/main/ArcGIS%20StoryMaps/Figure%2014.jpg">
</p>

Once your story is published, you can use the url for your StoryMap to direct viewiers to your work. If you need to find your StoryMap url in the future, simply reopen the StoryMap or look at the StoryMap in your Content tab.
