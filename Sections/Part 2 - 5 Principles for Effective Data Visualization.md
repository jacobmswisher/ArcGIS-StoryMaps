## Part 2: 5 Principles for Effective Data Visualization

After exploring one or more of the exemplary StoryMaps from the table above, you might be wondering how to create a StoryMap that is not only functional but is also compelling! As you've seen, having exciting and beautiful data visualizations, video, pictures, and audio can be useful in creating a great StoryMap, but *how* you utilize your chosen data visualizations and other media is just as important. As you begin designing your first StoryMap, keep in mind these 5 principles for data visualization that will help you harness the full potential of ArcGIS StoryMaps.

### Principle 1: Design Always Serves the Data

Before building your data vizualisation, its always worth taking some time to sketch out a design and think about what kind of vizualiation (map, graph, network, etc.) will do the best job of communicating the argument you are trying to advance with your data. Think about what kind of geometry would best serve your data (ex. bar graph vs pie chart) and immerse yourself in mind of your viewers, keeping in mind that people generally read top to bottom and left to right.

### Principle 2: Color, Shape, and Design Choices Produce Meaning

The choices you make regarding the color pallete of your data visualization ([which should always be accessible to colorblind viewers](https://davidmathlogic.com/colorblind/#%23D81B60-%231E88E5-%23FFC107-%23004D40)), the geometry of your data visualization, the positioning and orientation of your data and captions can shape how viewers percieve meaning in a data visualization. Take, for example, these two versions of visualizing the number of deaths during the U.S.-led war in Iraq by Simon Scarr ([left](http://www.simonscarr.com/iraqs-bloody-toll)) and Andy Cotgreave ([right](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3088166/why-how-to-lie-with-statistics-did-us-a-disservice.html)).

### Principle 3: Minimize Excess

Only include elements necessary to helping your viewer understand your data visualization and avoid unnecessary junk, such as distracting grid lines, unneeded graphics, or distracting colors.

### Principle 4: Explain Your Data

All data visualizations should be clearly labeled and include a textual explanation of the visualization and the data used. Text is incredibly useful in explaining the data visualization to the viewer, but remember that your data visualization communicates with the viewer too. To ensure that your visualization is clearly explained, include a text caption and check that the **lie factor** of your data is equal to 1.

### Principle 5: Be Honest
 
At their best, data visualizations are good approximations of relationships among the things in a dataset. At their worst, data visualizations mislead the viewer, often overstating certain patterns or connections while obscuring or ignoring others. All datasets, both good and bad, contain what researchers call **uncertainty**.

**Uncertainty** - A measure of how accurate, precise, and trustworthy data is. More uncertainty = less accuracy, precision, and trustworthiness.

It is **okay** to have some uncertainty in your dataset, but what's most important is that your are honest and up front with the viewer about the uncertainty of your data visualization.
